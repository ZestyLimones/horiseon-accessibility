# horiseon-accessibility

The purpose of this repository is to refactor an existing webpage to make it more accessable. 

Layout of the page remains the same: 

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/layout-mockup.png)

Links at the top located within the Navigation Bar will take you to the section within the webpage. 

The images and original code was provided by DU Bootcamp.
